# If I was into UBUNTU, this document would not exist
This is about an attempt (several actually), to use Elementary's Pantheon on Fedora and openSUSE (and Manjaro)

## I love (the idea of) pantheon

- Graphically well designed
- Comprehensive (like Gnome)
- Embraces the minimalist CSD-app <=> approach
- Feels snappier than Gnome (perception matters)

## Reality

Pantheon, a gnome-dependent desktop-environment, works brilliantly with its parent distribution 'Elementary OS'. <- no surprise there  
I don't like ubuntu-based anything, so I would rather eat beets than run Elementary.  
The inherent challenges of this type of upstream dependency (budgie, deepin, pantheon) result in a product that is significantly less distribution-agnostic than independent DE's (xfce, gnome, plasma).  
Hence the lack of an official Pantheon 'spin' on any of my favorite Distributions.

## Gnome apps over a Pantheon session on an unintended distribution

Pros
- Fluid, beautiful and gentle on the resources
- Circumvents the settings-restricted elementary-app-verse
- The non-traditional button layout and session-specific theming can be easily covered by Gschema override(s)

Cons
- Pantheon shell-theme compatibility issues
- lightdm and light-locker clumsily work as a session locker
- non-functional media/specialty keys (with no easy workaround)
- non-functional links and buttons

## The turning-point
The increasing tweak:usage ratio still leaves several non-functional bits, along with the realization that gnome can be made more responsive by reducing it's searchable apps

- The media/specialty-key issue is a gala/gnome-settings-daemon incompatibility that is somewhat petty, but still presents the need for yet another workaround
- It mostly works just fine. It's totally daily drivable. Spousal acceptance factor? not high enough...  

In the end, I would rather handicap gnome, or simply deal with the occasional (perceived) sluggish shell, or dress-the-hell-out-of xfce, than continue pretending that this implementation of Pantheon is a reliable, fully-functional solution.

### My problem with gnome is not gnome.
I find the gnome-shell defaults (as a starting point) preferrable to any other DE, which consistently results in a very low tweak:usage ratio.  
I stray from gnome primarily because my (elder) hardware exhibits difficulty handling gnome's thorough-ness.
