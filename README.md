## NOTES

Distribution	|	the good |	the bad
--:|:--:|:--
**openSUSE** 2019/02	|	zypper,yast,snapper,rolling,Nvidia repo,current	| yast/SUSE approach inherently introduces: 1) SUSEâ€™s own way of doing things 2) a duplication of existing DE tools 3) less DE intregration
**Fedora** 2016/11	|	dnf,DE-transparent,Nvidia repo,current	| short support life, but not rolling.
**Manjaro** 2016/08	|	Out-of-the-box brilliance, insane package/DE availability, DE-transparent, Nvidia easiest, current	| feels a little unbridled for me. I like the protections offered by the enterprise-backed distros.
**elementary** (pantheon) 2016/09|	Gnom-ish but: prettier, snappier	| **Elementary:** Ubuntu-based. **Pantheon:** settings/options are too limited, forcing command-line hackery for petty customization
**Mint** (cinnamon) 2016/03	|	Out-of-the-box brilliance; familiar, centralized settings	| **Mint:** Ubuntu-based. **cinnamon:** feels old/dated, resource hog, anti-csd
**Ubuntu** (unity) 2014/09	|	good enough	| **Ubuntu:** not a fan of apt-get, Ubuntu uses a different filesystem-framework than the other gnu/linux standards. **Unity:** Never truly settled into the unity way-of-things
--- | --- | ---
**Desktop Environment**	|	**the good**	|	**the bad**
gnome	|	beautiful, minimalist approach, gtk4/csd | resource hog (functions, but not as graphically snappy on older hardware)
xfce	|	light on resources, graphically snappy, runs csd apps | not as cohesive as gnome
budgie	|	GNOME-like but snappier, more cohesive than XFCE	| less cohesive than GNOME, less snappy than XFCE, less mature/complete than both
